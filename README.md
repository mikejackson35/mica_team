# mica_team

Our project starts with 2 csv files located in our resources folder that we all used to do our individual parts of the project.

raw.csv # This is the file of all the QB statistics from csv downloads from our source, sports-reference.com
static_data.csv #Thi is the file of the final 88 QBs in our study population

To create static_data.csv please refer to path_to_static_csv.ipnyb notebook
To create raw.csv please refer to path_to_static_data.ipynb

From there, we each have notebooks to produce data analysis and charts.
